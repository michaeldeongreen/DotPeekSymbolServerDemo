1) Create NuGet Package

2) Install dotPeek

3) Open dotPeek and add NuGet Packages you want to debug

4) Run the dotPeek Symbol Server (screen-001.png)

5) Open Visual Studio and go to Tools => Options => Debugging

6) Under General, uncheck "Enable Just My Code" and check "Enable .NET Framework source stepping" (screen-002.png)

7) Under Symbols, add http:localhost:33417, which is the address and port of the dotPeek Symbol Server you started in the earlier step (screen-003.png)

8) Install the NuGet Package, call into one of the methods and watch as you are able to debug the NuGet dll(s) (screen-004.png thru 005.png).

Issues:
1) "The breakpoint failed to bind."

	See screen-006.png
	
Observations:
1) After initial start up of debugger, each subsequent debugging session start up was fast

2) Even after upgrading the NuGet package, stopping dotPeek Symbol Server and adding the new NuGet Package, debugging session was faster	

3) I suspect the symbol cache denoted in Tools => Options => Debugging => Symbols is blown up after maybe a PC reboot

4) As noted in the dotPeek Symbol Server Tutorial towards the bottom, you will not be able to see local variables in the NuGet Package if the Package was published in Release mode.  I re-published in Debug mode to satisfy my curiousity and confirmed this.
